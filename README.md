##Exploring the sample and the Watson Content Hub search API capabilities

<div class="paragraph">
The WCH search service is built on the powerful SOLR search engine, and the
search parameters offer a great number of useful features for searching and
controlling the returned search results. In this sample you can select from a
list of example search queries to try them out and to see the search parameters
that are used. You can also edit the search parameters input to try your own
search queries. Changes made to inputs reflect immediately in the search link
at the bottom. The link can either be copied to the clipboard with the `Copy`
button or clicked directly.
